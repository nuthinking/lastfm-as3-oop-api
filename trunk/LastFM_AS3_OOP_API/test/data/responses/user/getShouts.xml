    <body>Thanks a lot for pissing all over me as a non-american/briton/german. I have subscribed to your service for years now and always felt it was worth every penny - but what Last.fm is doing now is just insulting. The irony is that if everybody (even those in the privileged countries) would have to pay a fee to use the radio you would have earned more money and I'm pretty sure the reactions wouldn't have been half as hostile as the ones you get now. If there is an award for stupid business decision-making Last.fm is from now on my main favourite to &quot;win&quot; it.</body>

    <body>I live in Germany originally. So is it means that i don't listen to radio because i'm from Hungary recently? I guess I must move back to home.
Few instant message network solved their money problem. I guess they got some money after that AD what is under the partner list in their clients. I pointed at MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, AIM and whatever IM services. I advise to personalizing the radio client or create a stylish information page with an idiot AD in header or at the bottom before/after tags.

In subscription:
I can choose between Dollar, Font, and Euro. All for 3... (like in kid stories) what means $3.00, €3.00 and £3.00 per month and the RATES?
I don't know but i feel it will be a suicide for the last.fm... it was a really one sided and unconsidered step what will be prosperous to other online radio services....


Please continue, BUT! Watch out for those little things what made the last.fm the first and the biggest online social radio network....</body>

    <body>You are in this very moment effectively destroying the whole basis for your previous success. The ability to enjoin the musical diversity and quality of a global community, especially for those who provide valuable and time-consuming work in updating first-world listeners to what's happening in the rest of the world, will simply disappear, and so will your subscribers in the first world. The dynamic which distinguished Last.fm from others, such as Spotify and illegal file-sharing, has vanished, and will eventually leave us a watered down first-world community of internet radio listeners. </body>

    <body>Hello,
I wanted to ask, who was the genius behind the whole &quot;charge third world country users&quot; idea?
Because us: latinamerica, africa, oriental europe, we cannot afford, or pay for this service. Paypal doesnt work in many of our countries, and some of them (like mine) have absurd laws like a prohibition of currency exchange.

This is what is going to happen: we will have to leave. we will leave and open an account in libre.fm. And you will not gain a dime because the users that are going to stay will be those who dont use the radio or those in US and UK and Germany.

And then, once all the millions of users that do not live in those countries flee. Your website will lose most of its content. UK and US users will leave, and lastfm will be JUST ANOTHER music website. Sorry boys but wrong decision-making.</body>

    <body>I'd love to hear an answer to Rafacarrascosa's questions.  It's bad enough the fee service is discriminatory in and of itself, but I just read on the forums that even those outside the USA/UK/DE who pay the 'script fee will still not get the same services as those within the above countries.  No On-Demand service, among other things.  This should be embarrassing to you - and I've been here since the Audioscrobbler days; joined in 2004 and remember the ethic back then, and how much potential there was, and all the promise (and promises).  What happened to that spirit?  Would the person from 5 years ago have allowed this inexcusable inequity?.............p.s., this is not a 'nasty' comment, but the actions of the site's representatives are nasty.  There's a difference between being nasty and being (correctly) critical.  If most didn't care, they'd just leave.  It's because they care that they stay and protest - consider that before you destroy this community and further.</body>

    <body>Bandwidth cost goes in a per listener basis.
Publicity fee is charged (or should be) based on the size of the target audience. ie, if you have 1,000 users from Argentina and 1,000,000 in USA, you should get paid 1,000 times more for publicity in USA.
Following this, the (bandwidth cost)/(publicity income per user) ratio is constant.

I think you guys are not being completely honest about why the radio service is going to be paid.

Is my reasoning wrong? why? how?</body>

I can understand that this is a business and you want to take advantage of it.  The fact of wanting to charge 3 euros I see right, but I will not pay. 
I just do not pay for others to benefit. I find these differences among countries are unfair.

    <body>Hello RJ.

As orkut, facebook, myspace and the other bunch role of communities of the web did, can't you just find another way to get the money you need to keep this website?

Last.fm is incredible, but nobody wants to pay for this. Not in the directly way.

In Brazil, we see that myspace have found a way to keep it on, while adversiting its artists, and those who wants to be like that.

I think that last fm could transform itself on a very best website, by simple. Don't ask for our money, but for those who are here to sell it (artists, records, tv channel,etc).

    <body>who took this beautiful decision to pay for listen to the radio? and why not in UK, USA and Deutschland? But our statistics and our infos are free, isn't it? I hope that Linux takes audioscrobbler and make you fail, and to have subscribers more and more ignorant!</body>

You broke my heart, and i think that of many other enthousiastic members. Sad. Very very sad. I hope you make the last.fm radio free again. Farewell.</body>

    <body>Hi! just a suggestion, remove the word &quot;gratis&quot; on the Spanish site (where you can read something like &quot;listen to the radio and get recommendations for free&quot;), that's deceptive advertising and you could get sued in Spain. I'm sorry for you taking this decision and the way you took it, I think you should not have made 2 groups of countries. I don't know for how long will I stay here, but what's for sure is that this is no longer my favourite place on the web. And one more thing, I'm a subscriber, and I was a subscriber before you made the announcements.</body>

    <body>Why do people in the Big $$$ Three generate enough revenue, because they also enjoy the interchange with people from other countries. When this will diminish , last.sm will be a less interesting place for them too and soon they also have to pay, because they don't generate enough money .......... Really think about these matters before taking unwise decisions and destroy what has been a nice place to stay ! For me the money is not the problem, but this Empty Head Thinking is awful and the discrimination of the people who MADE this site is unacceptable. Without profound changes in policy there is not much reason to become a payer ever again.</body>

    <body>I’m going to think about dropping my lastfm account (even if I´m living in “free-of-fee-Germany”) if lastfm goes ahead with that. Why? I’m very much into Spanish/Latin music. Users from Spain/Latin America will disappear if they have to pay for (part of) the service. Their input which I appreciate so much will disappear likewise. How much is 3 Euros per month for an average person in South America? About 1-2 percent of income? If you would apply this on an average German income this would mean paying 20-40 Euros per month just for listening radio… That´s crazy!</body>

    <body>I didnt know last.fm had been acquired by CBS... jst read your announcement about it... honestly you speak about them being progressive and being all positive... I hope I'll be proven wrong, but experience taught me that when a company acquires another one, it often ends it tears for the people of the company that's been acquirred...

and about the new system... I was about to start using the powerplay campaign but if people need to pay and I need to pay... I'm like.. hmmm will people actually pay to get to hear my songs... I really doubt that... even if it's unfair to musician artists, it seems music is now taken granted for free... so I guess most of the surfers will find an alternative platform to last.fm... stilll hope to be proven wrong.. cause I really like last.fm.. I even did an application to come work in LDN...;)

As i spent most of my days in Austria and have known this country for a couple of years now, I would suggest  last.fm should work harder on the austrian market - it's a small country but man, Austria has serious money to spend! ;) can't believe it's not possible to find enough sponsors here..

    <body>Hi again, Richard. Maybe I could tell you my experience? I discovered lastfm in January this year and became really enthusiastic about it all. What surprised me most is that I didn't mind not being able to listen to what I wanted on the radios, because the scrobbling of other people guided me well, it really worked! Now that the radios are not going to be free for most of the world, I'm not going to give my scrobbling for free anymore, especially because it'll remain free elsewhere... I know you know that you're going to lose users in these countries, users that helped with their scrobbling. I hoped that lastfm would develop in my country, but that's not going to be the case because of this stupid move (don't tell me there was no other solution, you've got business and marketing people in your offices, and don't tell me there were no less humiliating solutions). How many staff members are going to be laid off because this loss of users? I guess your boss doesn't mind... </body>

    <body>Richard - I'm not blowing smoke up your arse, but I really think that you've received a awful lot of unnecessary abuse following last week’s announcement. In life nothing of value is ever really free, so whether revenue to support the site is generated via advertising in lucrative regions, or by a subscription model, if it provides last.fm with longevity that’s got to be a good thing. Thanks for the site, I love it :-)</body>

    <body>Thank you for response. There're few words on my opinion. Firstly the decision you made is just not fair for all the people who like meself brought new listeners here, wrote the wikis, contributed in translation, uploaded photos and videos, provided info to make last.fm better (similar artists feature, huge last.fm database, fingerprinting etc) and improved the service from modest audioscrobbler to splendid last.fm. Secondly, what about the artists? The possibility of carrying their music to net-wide audience was the driving force for many artists to sign on but I think many of &quot;lesser&quot; ones didn't want to get _any_ royalties if it restricts their possible audience and they still don't. Thirdly, the way those news were delivered was absolutely disgraceful. I was dumbfounded by _that_ blog entry. The message was absolutely clear - &quot;ok lads, the dirty work were made, now pay or f*ck off. You have five (!) days to decide your future&quot;. You MUST revise and correct it. Last.fm name at stake.</body>

    <body>Thanks for your answer. This site is interesting for its community aspect and for the radios, the 2 combined had some appeal to me when I discovered it. I know some people don't use the radios but the radios are good for lastfm: it makes you buy music you wouldn't have come upon otherwise (like any other free fm radio btw). Is this not the goal of this site and the music &quot;industry&quot;? The fact that some other sites are not available in all countries is one of the features I liked in Lastfm. Unfortunately, lastfm is now spoiling all this by introducing humiliating conditions: offering more features to free users and less, compared to uk, de and us, for those who pay. I think that's not going to change because it's been decided, and that's a terrible blunder, &quot;marketingly&quot; speaking. I fully understand the pressure from the record companies, not the wisest people imho. I'm terribly sorry for the French-speakin moderators who are going to lose their jobs. Thanks again for your answer.</body>

    <body>I don't think the problem lies in the decision itself; it's the communication of it. It could have been handled more sensitively. Openess and management of expectations is everything. Still, I'm happy to stay and pay -- I was paying anyway.</body>

    <body>Is there any FM radio that charges people for listening? NO. On the other hand, your users built your database and your radio channels, so they should be allowed to use it for free. Perhaps you could add some voice adds to the stream of non subscribers, but nothing more.</body>

    <body>It`s not fair at all... People from the richest countries will use lastfm fo free and those, who live in the poor countries will have to pay for it... It`s very sad.  After this f*cking changes a lot of users (most part) will just say &quot;bye bye&quot; to you. And I also think that your main lapse is that you said about this changes too late - shortly before april. You had to think about it and give users more time to take the right dicision. This fact makes people more angry.

P.S. And one more - BYE BYE!</body>

    <body>Thanks RJ, for your reply. (I actually little expected that, and I'm glad you wrote back!) But that was not what I was asking ... Why couldn't you tell all of us affected by e-mails, not a blog post, and why you wrote &quot;soon&quot; when the &quot;soon&quot; is only a few days away? Nevermind. I'm just complaining. Next time you make a big change, do remember to do this via e-mail, and well in advance - as this is not a design change. That would upset less people. I've already made my mind up. I'll leave without deleting my account (with most of my existing listening data remaining as it is). Thanks a lot for all the fun over the years. I'll miss last.fm. I'm sorry it has come to this bitter ending on my side.</body>

Just because I live in another country I have to pay money and Americans don't? If you do this, just make all the British, American and German people pay as well, now you guys are treating the rest of the world like second-class users.</body>

    <body>This I understand and I can get the picture you get from your viewing point. The things is that even though some countries have better chances of covering costs with ads it doesn't mean that you need to start drawing lines to separate people based on the state they belong. The main prolem people have for which Last.fm is getting shouted at and spit on, at the moment, is the seeming discrimination that they face. That's just what the Internet is all about - no borders. The company could have taken into consideration a different aproach; let's say 2 euros/month for all users no matter their nationality and a very explicit post as to why this matter has been resulted to (I.E: We need money to sustain LAST.FM and offer you the best support etc. even some little drama as to &quot;Oh no, we're broke&quot;). Now you're faced with bad publicity and should one of your competitors rise up, you could start loosing users by the thousands.--&gt; Imagine Myspace trying to pull something similar. Facebook anyone?</body>

    <body>It's a sad day for music lovers all over the world ... Even if you guys at Last.fm have a good reason to make this change, your announcement was handed extremely poorly. You simply stated the fact but (consciously or unconsciously) didn't bother explaining the reason. Perhaps that's what makes so many people angry, me included. Or did you think we would simply grin and bear it? The vehemence of your users' reaction means that so many of us really love Last.fm. Perhaps you (or the bosses at CBS) could communicate better and show ALL listeners some more respect. I won't stop using Last.fm, but will keep on protesting any way I seem fair until you provide all your clients with a satisfactory answer.</body>

    <body>well, you listened me, you answered me and for the first time i hear something coherent about this. (next time, maybe will be a good idea explain all the reasons in the blog article). I dont know if i will keep my subscription, and i know for you one user means nothing, but, i thought this was something different, you know what im talking about, and if you say there are not another alternatives, like limit a quantity of songs per day, maybe ebay personalized ads by country, or make a brainstorming with the users to find another solution (this is not open source, but maybe some ideas could work) and if you say there are no way to make it fairer and distributive worldwide (it still sound like is some award to ad-clickers countries) i have to believe you, because i have no more arguments and i dont know how are lastfm internal numbers. maybe, just maybe, find a more empathic way to say things such this in the blog next time. im no one, its just an opinion in the ether of internet. thanks</body>

    <body>I understand that but keep in mind that it's a community based site here, built not only by developers and moderators, that people have invested in it, that lastfm branded it as &quot;social&quot;, like a music-oriented facebook+free streaming. What would you say about a community where the ones that pay have less than the ones that have it all free? Where those who gave content for free, will now have to pay? That's not a community anymore. (and don't tell me the content remains free as without the music streaming, this site is pointless) How can you ask people not to feel humiliated ? (I feel so like this and will never come back again as humiliation lasts long)  Because we don't bring enough money compared to the others? It's your own fault if you didn't manage to conclude ad contract in my country, not mine. Imagine we'd do the same in society, for ex making tourists in France pay double price for food? That would be revolting, that wouldn't be honest. It 'simple as that', as you said.

    <body>The thing is, we can cover the costs of streaming in us,uk,de with advertising, and we can't in other countries because their online ad markets are a lot tougher. 

We have listeners in almost every country in the world - it's simply impossible to have ad-sales teams in every country, and stuff like google ad-sense doesn't even come close to covering the licensing fees.

It sucks that we have to charge some people, but we're keeping it free (ad-supported) in countries where we can sell enough ads to pay the bills. Simple as that.

    <body>hi there! 
i've been a last.fm subscriber for years now (am from belgium) and have always paid the 3 €/month...however...
if you truly need more money, make everybody pay, but don't discriminate...even if you're already getting a lot of revenue from the US, the UK and Germany...don't treat us (the rest of the world) as test tube babies...moreover, those three countries have richer citizens (on average) than the rest of us...so, make the rich pay, and don't extort the poorer...or are you going to introduce new and better paid service (on demand?) in those three countries, and are you therefore trying to make a difference between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, in order to make it more attractive for &quot;them&quot;? anyway, you are discriminating, which is a very serious offense in my opinion...just when i thought music was able to cross barriers, you're putting new ones up...</body>

No money - no new servers etc. Not excluding countries which bring you money - too many users leave. Other than that, music can't be free. That's an illusion and violates copyright. Switching to iLike is a bad thing to do. They just copied last.fm features while they don't have a huge catalogue nor any useful features.</body>

    <body>Hey, I'm not one of those 'free free free free' people, I understand some things, and didn't see problems to pay but... your statemente isn't clear enough.

You just say 'In order to keep providing the best radio service on the web, we need to ask our listeners from countries other than USA, UK and Germany to subscribe for €3.00 per month. In return you’ll get unlimited access to Last.fm Radio, and a promise that we’ll be hard at work improving the service for years to come.'

But you know, you didn't explain why!!!!

All I'm asking is. Make another post explain the details, why people need pay and why this countries will not need to pay. Fair enough don't you think?

I will thank you a lot if you answer me, even i could think again about quitting my subscription, i know, my 3$ per month will not make richer anybody, but i think the problem is deeper than 3$, is about discrimination about something we thought you was different, you know about what im talking about.

    <body>Heh.
The main thing that saddens me is this kind of discrimination that is starting to pop out everywhere on the Internet.
I first experienced it with YouTube: &quot;This video is not available in your country or domain&quot;. It was like a punch in the face. Did I choose to be born in a country other than the three mentioned in the post you wrote? No.
I find this extremely stupid and illegal as it gives me a great sense of insecurity. It's like making fun of a handicapped person just because he was born this way.
And that is our situation as well, we were born here, we did not choose it, we did not choose to be male or female and we did not choose our country. 
It is in my strongest opinion that law has to catch up with this kind of discrimination, unthought-of before, as it is something that could happen only in this world, that of the Internet.
No matter how secure you feel about the decision you are about to make, as it is not prohibited, it defies moral values.

    <body>Hello! I'm sorry for bothering, but I'd like you to know about [url=http://www.last.fm/forum/21713/_/356752]this fact[/url] and if it is possible take care of solving this problem. I know that there are a lot of other things that are demanding, but if anyone would write Londun that would be corrected immediately, right? Thank you for attention, Serhiy. </body>

    <body>hi! i think there should be the possibility for the creator to tag his own published chart images or to file them under tv&amp;films/music (w/ sub-cats)/technics/cartoon/nature/.. how about that? it's a useless waste of serverspace having so many great chart images on last.fm when nobody apart from their creators knows about them!</body>

are we from the same musical gene pool?

in case your interested a broad green play a mesmerising mix of folky acoustics and chilled electronica, overlaying understated harmonies, bewitching mantras and beats.

if you have time please feel free to kick off your shoes and take a listen.  if you like please let us know.

enjoy
